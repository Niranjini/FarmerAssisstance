# FarmerAssisstance

Description
------------------
This solution aims at providing assistance to the farmers, especially in the current scenario where farmers are one of the worst affected people. Due to COVID-19 situation farmers are facing many challenges due lack of human assistance/labour, transportation facility, storage, fertilizers/pesticides/machinery, etc. They cannot sell their crops also. The markets are closed, worker class people are migrating to their home towns. Farmers have no way to fulfil the farming requirements. As a result large quantity of crops are being dumped or wasted which will impact not only the poor farmers but also the economy of the country. In turn it will affect the economy of the country and might result into food inflation prices.

To solve this problem, we are presenting ‘Farmer’s Assistance’ solution. It is a solution which developed for farmers, which will help them to connect with the government/or concerned authority. They can raise request for their requirements via a chatbot which is developed using IBM Watson chatbot. In this solution farmers are provided with platform, where they can sell their harvest to food companies/concerned authorities by providing certain details such as production details and location details.

Key feature of the solution:
1.	Chatbot bases assistance for farmers to raise requests, which will be addressed soon
2.	Platform for farmers to directly interact with buyers, by providing some details
3.	Mobile App available in regional language
4.	Based on IBM Watson and Mobile first Platform

Farmers can:
1.	Request for Human assistance/Labour
2.	Request for Farm tools/equipments or farm machinery
3.	Request for pesticides/manure/fertilizers/seeds, etc
4.	Request for transportation facility
5.	Request for storage facility
6.	Directly sell their produce to buyers
7.	Any other assistance

User Roles:
1.	Farmer or Sarpanch on behalf of farmers
2.	Buyers (Food companies/) – To be implemented later


Project roadmap
----------------
This app will collect necessary data such as farmer details, their crop production details, their location, etc. In the longer run a large amount of data would be collected which can be used for data analytics. By using a mix of Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics this solution can be used for:

1.	Weather prediction and how it will affect farmers. In advance farmers will be given necessary warnings or assistance
2.	App will be integrated with centralized server for all food companies. Using machine learning calculate the grain/crop produce for each quarter/year in future. It would be beneficial for both farmers and food companies.
3.	Food buyers will be onboarded
